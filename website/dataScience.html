                <p>
                    Before starting my in-depth exploration of Kotlin, I thought that this section of my final project
                    was going to be the most straight forward. It actually turned out that this was one of the more
                    painful sections to complete. Below, I will document my experiences with Kotlin for data science,
                    and then I will compare this with the offerings from Python, the leading language in the data
                    science domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin, I read the <a
                        href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-science-overview.html"><u>documentation</u></a>,
                    which
                    mentioned two ways to get started. The first is by
                    downloading and running a local Jupyter Notebook. This is an open source web application that allows
                    you to create and share "notebooks" that contain a combination of code, markdown, and
                    visualizations. Notebooks are great because they allow you to run code a block at time. When using a
                    Jupyter Notebook, you will need to install the open-source
                    <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter"><u>Kotlin-Jupyter</u></a>
                    Kotlin Kernel since
                    these
                    notebooks primary run Python. Unfortunately this kernel is still in beta, so there are plenty of
                    bugs, and it only works with certain versions of Jupyter. The second way that you can get started is
                    through an alternative, and slightly less popular, notebook called Zeppelin. Additionally, if you
                    are working in any Zeppelin version after 0.9.0, it already comes bundled with the Kotlin
                    interpreter. Since I have some experience using Jupyter Notebooks, I decided to go this route and
                    install the kernel myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you first visit the kotlin-jupyter Github page, you will see three ways to install the kernel.
                    Namely, you can use Conda, Pip, or build it from source. The first two are package managers for the
                    Python language. Initially, I tried to install the kernel using pip, but couldn't get it working.
                    Finally, I found another write-up explaining that the pip source is currently broken, so I built the
                    kernal from source. Poor documentation turned out to be a theme when I was figuring out how to use
                    Kotlin for data science. Currently, there are only 23 supported libraries that can be used with the
                    Kotlin kernel. Of these, I focused on two. Namely, I used lets-plot and krangl. Lets-plot is similar
                    to ggplot, a library for visualization within the R programming language. Krangl is a library for
                    data wrangling within the Jupyter Notebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is a screenshot of me accessing the notebook with the
                    Kotlin kernel for the first time, and the
                    output from the Jupyter Notebook server.
                </p>

                <img src="static/jupyterServer.png" alt="The output from the
                Jupyter Notebook server.">
                <p>
                    To gain some practice using all of these tools, I decided to analyze data on COVID-19, made
                    available by the Indiana State Department of Health. The first data set that I downloaded can be
                    found <a href="https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset/covid-19-county-statistics"><u>here</u></a>.
                    This
                    dataset contains the number of COVID cases, COVID deaths, and COVID tests for each
                    county in Indiana.
                </p>

                <img src="static/covidCounty.png" alt="A sample of COVID data
                for Indiana counties.">

                <p>After downloading this data, I used krangl to read it into the notebook from a CSV file as a
                    DataFrame object. Then, I was able to start parsing this DataFrame and visualizing the data. The
                    first thing that I did was calculate the total number of tests administered, which I found to be
                    1952202 and the total number of positive results, which I found to be 256744. Then, I used these
                    values to calculate the percentage of tests that come back positive. I found this value to be
                    approximately 13.15%.</p>

                <p>Next, I created a plot and several layers to visualize the effects of COVID-19 on various counties in
                    Indiana. The first graph that I created was the total number of COVID-19 cases per county in
                    Indiana. See the results below.</p>

                <img src="static/casesGraph.png" alt="COVID cases in each
                Indiana couny.">

                <p>Then, I created another layer to visualize the total number
                    of COVID-19 deaths per county in Indiana.
                    As you can see, this graph is strikingly similar to the graph
                    above.</p>

                <img src="static/deathGraph.png" alt="COVID deaths in each
                Indiana county.">

                <p>Having extracted much of the useful data out of that dataset, I decided to explore another. This
                    dataset was much smaller, but included datapoints on gender and age range as well as location in the
                    state. This dataset was also provided by the Indiana State
                    Department of Health, and can be found
                    <a href="https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset/covid-19-case-data"><u>here</u></a>.
                </p>

                <img src="static/covidGenderAge.png" alt="A sample of COVID data
                by gender and age for Indianapolis counties.">

                <p>My first interest in this dataset was how gender would effect the rates of contracting the virus. To
                    analyze this, I used Kotlin to filter the dataframe on each gender and then calculated the total
                    number of cases for both. Then, I used similar methods as above to generate a bar chart. This chart
                    can be seen below. In Indiana, the number of cases seem to be
                    independent of gender.</p>

                <img src="static/genderGraph.png" alt="COVID cases in Indiana by
                gender.">

                <p>Finally, I used the DataFrame to generate one more layer that examined age range on the number of
                    positive cases. Then, in each age range, I identified the number of individuals from each gender.
                    This graph can be seen below. From this graph, we can see that more individuals of ages 50 to 59
                    have contracted the virus than any other age group. </p>

                <img src="static/ageGraph.png" alt="COVID cases in Indiana by
                age group.">
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Of the four domains that I explored, data science was the least pleasant. Unfortunately, the
                    community just is not there yet. As mentioned above, there are currently only 23 libraries that are
                    supported for the Kotlin kernel, compared to the hundreds of libraries that could be found for
                    python or even R. Below is an image of the list of supported
                    libraries.</p>

                <img src="static/libraries.png" alt="Supported libraries.">

                <p>
                    In the supported libraries, there is very little documentation. I frequently found myself diving
                    into the source code to figure out how to use certain methods. All of that said, I really enjoy
                    working with Kotlin collections, so I hope that this community will grow in the future. I think that
                    Kotlin could potentially be a good fit for this domain because it allows for compact code that is
                    highly writable. However, for Kotlin to thrive in this environment, there will need to be much more
                    guidance.
