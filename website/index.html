        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          For my programming languages final project, I decided to do an in-depth exploration of the Kotlin programming
          language. Kotlin is a language that I have been curious about for a while, but I haven't ever had the time to
          explore fully. On the Kotlin website, they outline four main solution areas. Namely, these are mobile,
          server-side, web development, and data science. For my final project, I decided to build a small application
          in each of these domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the left, there are a series of links that will allow you to learn more about each section in particular.
          In each category, I go into the details of my implementation and then compare Kotlin to some of the top
          contenders in that domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          To explore Kotlin for web programming, I started with a "Hello, World!" program with the React framework in
          Kotlin/JS. Then, I built a more complete front end for a full-stack application that I built. To learn about
          Kotlin for server side programming, I built the backend for this full-stack application using Kotlin
          Multiplatform and the Ktor framework. To analyze Kotlin for mobile, I built an Android Dice Roller
          application. Finally, to see how Kotlin can be used for data Science, I installed an open-source Kotlin kernel
          in a local instance of Jupyter Notebook and used several libraries to explore the rates of the COVID-19 virus
          in different Indiana counties.
        </p>
        <h3>Integration of Course Material</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course of this project, I forced myself to become comfortable programming in Kotlin.
          Additionally, exploring these four different domains allowed me to evaluate the use of Kotlin in each. In each
          part of the project, I evaluate the use of Kotlin from the perspective of readability, writability, and level
          of guidance. From this final project, I have learned the use of the language must match the features
          available. Kotlin is a great fit for server-side programming and mobile development. However, I don't think
          that I would find myself using it for front end development or data science anytime soon.</p>
        <h3>Correctness</h3>
        <p>In each section, I include screenshots and videos to demonstrate my
          sample applications. Additionally, I link
          to the official Kotlin documentation when possible to verify my claims.</p>
        <h3>Technical Complexity</h3>
        <p>
          This project was not just about learning the Kotlin language.
          Throughout this project, I explored new IDEs and build tools,
          two new frameworks, and five new libraries, each with their own unique intricacies. By exploring the use of
          Kotlin in four different domains, I really had to dive into the entire Kotlin ecosystem. Additionally, many of
          the tools that I explored are still only in their alpha or beta stage
          of development. This means that there
          was little
          documentation available and many bugs left to work out. At times, I found myself digging through the source
          code for these libraries and frameworks to make my applications work.
        </p>

        <h3>About Kotlin</h3>
        <p>
          Kotlin is a statically typed, open-source programming language developed by JetBrains. It targets the JVM,
          Android, JavaScript, and Native. Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional programming constructs baked
          in. Compared to Java, Kotlin is much more concise and more null-safe, making it rarer to run into null pointer
          exceptions. Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java code, so it can be easily added to existing Java
          codebases.
